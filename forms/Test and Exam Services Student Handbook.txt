INTRODUCTION

Test and Exam Services is the University of Toronto department responsible for coordinating quiz, term test, and final exam accommodations for students with disabilities who are both registered with Accessibility Services on the Downtown Campus and authorized by Accessibility Services for quiz, test, and exam accommodations for Downtown Campus courses. 

Test and Exam Services administers quizzes, tests, and exams to students with disabilities who are enrolled in any department, in any faculty, and in any level of study on the Downtown Campus.

REGISTER FOR ACCOMMODATIONS

For every quiz, test, or exam that you wish to write with accommodations, submit an online accommodation request form to Test and Exam Services. You must submit one accommodation request form for each quiz, test, or exam that you wish to write with accommodations.

Register Online: www.ace.utoronto.ca/tes/register

Note that being registered with Accessibility Services only means that you may be eligible to write quizzes, tests, and exams with Test and Exam Services (if you are authorized to do so by your Disability Counsellor). However, being registered with Accessibility Services does not automatically schedule you to write all of your quizzes, tests, and exams with accommodations. To schedule yourself to write your quizzes, tests, and exams with accommodations, you must submit an online accommodation request form to Test and Exam Services for each evaluation.



CONFIRM TEST AND EXAM BOOKINGS

1. Registration Confirmation E-mail
When you successfully submit a request for accommodations for a quiz, test, or exam online, you will receive an automated registration confirmation e-mail at your University-issued e-mail account within 10 minutes. If you do not receive this automated registration confirmation e-mail:
a. Check your junk or bulk mail folder.
b. Assume that your request for accommodations did not submit successfully. Try again.

2. "My Registration History" Online
Go to clockwork.studentlife.utoronto.ca/custom/misc. To review all of the bookings that you have made with Test and Exam Services, click on "My Registration History". Note that "My Registration History" shows you the class quiz, test, or exam date and time for each of your bookings. Your sitting of each evaluation may be held on a different date, at a different time, and/or for a different duration depending on your accommodation plan.

3. Quiz, Test, or Exam Notification E-mail
When you are booked to write a quiz, test, or exam with accommodations, you will receive an automated notification e-mail reminding you of your evaluation start time and writing location one day prior (during the term) or two days prior (during an exam period) to your scheduled writing date. It is very important that you read this notification e-mail. Students who write quizzes, tests, and exams with accommodations may do so on a different date or at a different time than the class. As well, assigned writing locations will vary.

4. If you have any questions about accommodated quizzes, tests, or exams, please contact Test and Exam Services.
E-mail: tes.info@utoronto.ca
Telephone: 416-946-8584



ACADEMIC CONFLICTS

1. Conflict Scenario Number One: I have a lecture or tutorial scheduled immediately before my quiz or test.
If you have a lecture or tutorial scheduled immediately before your quiz or test, obtain written permission from the course instructor to begin writing the quiz or test 15 minutes later than the rest of the class begins writing the quiz or test to allow for travel time from the classroom to Test and Exam Services. Forward the written permission to Test and Exam Services at least 14 days prior to the quiz or test date. We will reschedule your sitting of the quiz or test accordingly. If you cannot provide 14 days' notice, forward the permission with as much notice as possible. Be aware that with less than 14 days' notice, rescheduling is not guaranteed.

2. Conflict Scenario Number Two: I have a lecture or tutorial scheduled immediately after my quiz or test.
If you have a lecture or tutorial scheduled immediately after your quiz or test, inform Test and Exam Services at least 14 days prior to the quiz or test date. We will reschedule your sitting of the quiz or test to a time slightly earlier than the class sitting to remedy the conflict. If you cannot provide 14 days' notice, inform us with as much notice as possible. Be aware that with less than 14 days' notice, rescheduling is not guaranteed. No matter what time you finish writing the quiz or test, you will be required to remain sequestered and supervised at the quiz or test location until 15 minutes past the time that the class is scheduled to begin writing the test.

3. Conflict Scenario Number Three: I have two final exams scheduled at the exact same time.
If you have two final exams scheduled at the exact same time, request accommodations for both final exams by registering with Test and Exam Services for each, as you normally would. We will adjust your exam schedule to remedy the conflict.



AUTOMATIC TEST AND EXAM RESCHEDULING

1. Automatic Rescheduling Scenario Number One: End of Day
If you are registered to write with Test and Exam Services and your authorized extra writing time and/or stopped-clock break accommodations cause your test or exam end time to be later than Test and Exam Services' closing time (typically 10:30 PM), your test or exam will automatically be rescheduled as early as necessary to ensure that your test or exam end time is before Test and Exam Services' closing time.

2. Automatic Rescheduling Scenario Number Two: Date and Time Shifting Accommodations
If you are authorized for one of the accommodations listed below, some or all of your test or exam dates and/or times may be automatically rescheduled to comply with the requirements of the accommodation.

• AM Test and Exam Writing Only

• PM Test and Exam Writing Only

• 11:00 AM Test and Exam Start Time

• 12:00 PM Test and Exam Start Time

• 6:00 PM Test and Exam End Time

• One Test or Exam Per Day

• One Day Between Tests and Exams

• Two Days Between Tests and Exams

If you are authorized for one of the accommodations listed above, automatic rescheduling of your tests and exams will occur in accordance with the established implementation procedure for the accommodation which you are authorized for, as outlined in the section of this handbook entitled "Time Shift Accommodations".

3. Automatic Rescheduling Scenario Number Three: Midterm Periods and Exam Periods
During busy times of the academic year, when there are significant increases in the number of requests for accommodated tests and exams, your test or exam sitting may be rescheduled up to one hour earlier than the class sitting if deemed necessary by Test and Exam Services. This means, for example, that your 4:15 PM test may be held with Test and Exam Services at 3:15 PM, or your 9:00 AM exam may be held at 8:00 AM.



TIME SHIFT ACCOMMODATIONS

1. AM Test and Exam Writing Only
If you are authorized by Accessibility Services for the AM Test and Exam Writing Only accommodation, your sitting of the evaluation will be rescheduled if the class sitting is scheduled at or after 12:00 PM. The evaluation will be rescheduled to the following business day between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM.

2. PM Test and Exam Writing Only
If you are authorized by Accessibility Services for the PM Test and Exam Writing Only accommodation, your sitting of the evaluation will be rescheduled if the class sitting is scheduled at or before 11:59 AM. The evaluation will be rescheduled to the same day between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM.

3. 11:00 AM Test and Exam Start Time
If you are authorized by Accessibility Services for the 11:00 AM Test and Exam Start Time accommodation, your sitting of the evaluation will be rescheduled if the class sitting is scheduled at any time other than 11:00 AM. The evaluation will be rescheduled to the same day at 11:00 AM. If the class sitting of the evaluation is scheduled at or after 11:00 AM, sequestering procedures apply, as outlined in the section of this handbook entitled "Sequestering".

4. 12:00 PM Test and Exam Start Time
If you are authorized by Accessibility Services for the 12:00 PM Test and Exam Start Time accommodation, your sitting of the evaluation will be rescheduled if the class sitting is scheduled at any time other than 12:00 PM. The evaluation will be rescheduled to the same day at 12:00 PM. If the class sitting of the evaluation is scheduled at or after 12:00 PM, sequestering procedures apply, as outlined in the section of this handbook entitled "Sequestering".

5. 6:00 PM Test and Exam End Time
If you are authorized by Accessibility Services for the 6:00 PM Test and Exam End Time accommodation, your sitting of the evaluation will be rescheduled if with your extra writing time and/or stopped-clock break accommodations cause your test or exam end time to be 6:01 PM or later. Your sitting of the evaluation will be rescheduled earlier on the same day to ensure that you will finish your test or exam at exactly 6:00 PM. If the class sitting of the evaluation is scheduled at or after the start time of your sitting of the evaluation, sequestering procedures apply, as outlined in the  section of this handbook entitled "Sequestering".

6. One Test or Exam Per Day
If you are authorized by Accessibility Services for the One Test or Exam Per Day accommodation, your sitting of the evaluation will be rescheduled if you have two evaluations scheduled with Test and Exam Services on the Downtown Campus on the same date. The latter evaluation chronologically will be rescheduled to the following business day between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM. Your sitting will not be rescheduled if you have only registered to write one of the two conflicting evaluations with Test and Exam Services or if the conflicting evaluations are occurring on different campuses.

7. One Day Between or Two Days Between Tests and Exams
If you are authorized by Accessibility Services for either the One Day Between Tests and Exams or the Two Days Between Tests and Exams accommodation, your sitting of the evaluation will be rescheduled if you have two evaluations scheduled with Test and Exam Services on the Downtown Campus with fewer than one or two full days (as applicable) between them. The latter evaluation chronologically will be rescheduled to the next business day that results in one or two full days (as applicable) between the two evaluations, between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM. Your sitting will not be rescheduled if you have only registered to write one of the two conflicting evaluations with Test and Exam Services or if the conflicting evaluations are occurring on different campuses.



SEQUESTERING

If your sitting of the quiz, test, or exam begins before the regularly-scheduled class sitting, regardless of what time you complete the quiz, test, or exam, you will be required to remain sequestered and supervised with Test and Exam Services until 15 minutes after the class' quiz or test start time or 45 minutes after the class' exam start time.

While being sequestered, you are permitted to read (no electronic devices), write (no electronic devices), stretch, rest, eat (no nuts), and use the washroom designated by the supervising Invigilator.

While being sequestered, you are not permitted to exit the test or exam location, communicate with others (Invigilators excepted), use or be in possession of a cell phone, a laptop, a tablet, an MP3 player, or any electronic device of any kind.



AFFIDAVITS

If your sitting of a quiz, test, or exam begins before or after the regularly-scheduled class sitting, immediately prior to writing, you will be required to sign an affidavit that states the following: "I certify that I have not received any prior indication about the content of the test or exam, nor will I reveal the content of the test or exam to anyone until the regularly-scheduled class sitting of the test or exam has ended."



MAKE-UP TERM TESTS

A make-up term test is any in-class, timed, term evaluation that you have made arrangements with the course instructor to write on a different date or time than the originally-scheduled test sitting. The date of the make-up test must fall during the academic session in which you are enrolled in the course. If you miss the originally-scheduled test sitting, contact the course instructor or course coordinator to discuss your options. Permission to write a make-up test is at the discretion of the course instructor or course coordinator. If the course instructor or course coordinator authorizes you to write a make-up test, she or he should specify the date and time that the make-up test is to be scheduled. If the course instructor or course coordinator do not have a preference about the date and time of the make-up test, choose a date and time that work for you. Request accommodations for the make-up test by following the instructions outlined in the section of this handbook entitled "Register for Accommodations".



DEFERRED TERM TESTS

A deferred term test is any in-class, timed, term evaluation that you have petitioned through your College or Faculty Registrar to write on a different date than the originally-scheduled test sitting. The date of the deferred test must fall after the academic session in which you are enrolled in the course. If you miss the originally-scheduled test sitting and you will be unable to complete a make-up test during the term in which you are enrolled in the course, file a petition to defer the test with your College Registrar (Faculty of Arts and Science) or Faculty Registrar (all other faculties). If your petition to defer the test is approved, the date and time that the deferred test is to be scheduled will be communicated to you by your Registrar. Request accommodations for the deferred test by following the instructions outlined in the section of this handbook entitled "Register for Accommodations".



DEFERRED FINAL EXAMS

A deferred final exam is any final course evaluation that was originally held during a formally-scheduled exam period that you have petitioned through your College or Faculty Registrar to write on a different date than the originally-scheduled exam sitting. If you miss the originally-scheduled exam sitting, file a petition to defer the test with your College Registrar (Faculty of Arts and Science) or Faculty Registrar (all other faculties). Note that filing a petition to defer an exam does not guarantee that a deferral will be granted. If your petition to defer the exam is approved, the date and time that the deferred exam is to be scheduled will be communicated to you by your Registrar. Request accommodations for the deferred exam by following the instructions outlined in the section of this handbook entitled "Register for Accommodations".



LATE REGISTRATION

1. If you missed the registration deadline:

• Request accommodations for the quiz, test, or exam right away by completing a Late Registration After the Deadline Form and submitting it to Test and Exam Services.

• Check your e-mail for a response from Test and Exam Services. We will assess your late request for accommodations and let you know whether or not it has been approved.

• If your late request for accommodations is approved, you will be scheduled to write the evaluation with Test and Exam Services. You will receive all of your authorized accommodations, unless you are advised otherwise prior to the quiz, test, or exam date.

• If your late request for accommodations is not approved, you will not be scheduled to write the evaluation with Test and Exam Services. Instead, you will be offered the options outlined later in this section.

• Connect with your counsellor at Accessibility Services if you missed the registration deadline due to extenuating disability-related circumstances.

• Check the registration deadlines and make note of them to ensure that in future, you request accommodations on time.

• Note that accommodations are not guaranteed to late registrants.

2. If your late request for TERM TEST accommodations is not approved:

• You may ask the course instructor to coordinate your accommodations for the quiz or test. Be aware that course instructors are not obligated to provide quiz or test accommodations.

• You may ask the course instructor to permit you to write a make-up term test at a later date, which you can then register again to write with accommodations. Be aware that course instructors are not obligated to approve requests to write make-up tests. For more information about make-up tests, review the section of this handbook entitled "Make-Up Term Tests".

• You may write the term test with your classmates during the regularly-scheduled quiz or test sitting without any accommodations.

• Connect with your disability counsellor at Accessibility Services to discuss other options that might be available to you if you missed the accommodation registration deadline due to significant, extenuating disability-related circumstances (e.g. extended hospitalization).

3. If your late request for FINAL EXAM accommodations is not approved:

• You may submit a petition to defer the final exam with your College Registrar (Faculty of Arts and Science) or Faculty Registrar (all other faculties). If the petition to defer the exam is granted, you can then register again to write with accommodations. Be aware that filing a petition to defer an exam does not guarantee that a deferral will be granted. For more information about deferred exams, review the section of this handbook entitled "Deferred Final Exams".

• You may write the final exam with your classmates during the regularly-scheduled exam sitting without any accommodations.

• Connect with your disability counsellor at Accessibility Services to discuss other options that might be available to you if you missed the accommodation registration deadline due to significant, extenuating disability-related circumstances (e.g. extended hospitalization).

• Note that the course instructor, the course coordinator, Test and Exam Services staff, and Accessibility Services staff are not authorize to assign an alternate final exam date (i.e. a "make-up" exam date).

• Note that the course instructor and course coordinator are not permitted to provide accommodations to you during the final exam. Most faculties (including the Faculty of Arts and Science) do not allow this.



WHAT TO EXPECT BEFORE YOU WRITE

1. Date, Time, and Location

• When you are booked to write a quiz, test, or exam with accommodations, you will receive an automated notification e-mail reminding you of your evaluation start time and writing location one day prior (during the term) or two days prior (during an exam period) to your scheduled writing date.

• It is very important that you read this notification e-mail. Students who write quizzes, tests, and exams with accommodations may do so on a different date or at a different time than the class. As well, assigned writing locations will vary.

2. Check-in

• Arrive at the assigned writing location at least 15 minutes prior to the quiz, test, or exam start time assigned to you by Test and Exam Services.

• Check-in with an Invigilator by submitting your student identification card (TCard). Your official arrival time is the time at which you hand your TCard to the Invigilator. The Invigilator will maintain possession of your TCard for the duration of your quiz, test, or exam.

• Test and Exam Services does not compensate students for quiz, test, or exam writing time lost due to late arrival, regardless of whether or not this is the practice of your department or faculty of enrolment. If you arrive at the assigned writing location after the quiz, test, or exam start time assigned to you by Test and Exam Services, you can expect that time will be deducted from your overall writing time and additional consequences may be imposed, such as being denied permission to write the quiz, test, or exam.

3. Your Belongings

• Place your belongings - including your cell phone - in the area designated by the invigilator. In EX340, students are asked to place their belongings in a locker in the lobby, which the Invigilator locks.

• You may only bring into the quiz, test, or exam location authorized items. Any items that you bring into the location are subject to inspection by the Invigilator (e.g. pencil case, food and drink items, medication containers, etcetera). Unauthorized electronic devices (such as a cell phone or a smartwatch) are prohibited.

4. Sign-In

• Wait in the lobby until you are called by the Invigilator to be signed-in.

• During sign-in, the Invigilator will:
a. Communicate the details of the quiz, test, or exam, including authorized writing time and permitted quiz, test, and exam aids.
b. Review the details of your authorized quiz, test, and exam accommodation plan with you.
c. Ask that you sign your Test or Exam Administration Form confirming that you understand and agree to the accommodations authorized.
d. Ask that you sign a Student Declaration confirming that you are "not in possession of any unauthorized test or exam aids (such as notes) or unauthorized electronic devices (such as a cell phone or a smartwatch)".
e. Inspect any items that you have chosen to keep with you during the quiz, test, or exam (e.g. pencil case, food and drink items, medication containers, etcetera).

• The Invigilator will escort you to your assigned desk.

5. Important Reminders

• Prior to the commencement of a quiz, test, or exam, you are expected to refrain from writing, typing, or designating any answers to questions on any quiz, test, or exam materials.

• Invigilators do not have the authority to change your authorized quiz, test, and exam accommodation plan in any way. If your accommodation plan is not meeting your needs, contact your Disability Counsellor at Accessibility Services to discuss the possibility of making changes for future quizzes, tests, and exams.

• Access to Test and Exam Services' quiz, test, and exam locations, including EX340, is restricted to the students scheduled to write with accommodations, the Invigilators supervising the students, and select University of Toronto staff and faculty. Family and friends are welcome to wait for you in the lobby.

• With respect to the safety of students with environmental sensitivities and allergies, EX340 is a scent-sensitive, nut-sensitive space. Refrain from wearing perfume, cologne, or other strong scents. Ensure that food and body products (e.g. lotions) are free of nuts, nut oils, and traces of nuts.



WHAT TO EXPECT WHILE YOU WRITE

1. Accommodations

• During the writing of a quiz, test, or exam with Test and Exam Services, you will receive all of the accommodations that are authorized to you by your Disability Counsellor at Accessibility Services (unless you have been informed otherwise in advance of the quiz, test, or exam, e.g. because you missed the accommodation registration deadline).

2. Writing Time

• The Invigilator will calculate and monitor your authorized quiz, test, or exam writing time. You will receive a warning approximately 10 minutes prior to the expiration of your writing time, then you will be advised when your writing time has expired.

• You are encouraged to monitor your own writing time throughout the quiz, test, or exam and pace your writing accordingly. Note that cell phones and smartwatches are not permitted timekeeping devices.

3. Break Time

• If you wish to take a supervised break during a quiz, test, or exam, you must notify the Invigilator upon beginning and upon ending the break. During a break:
a. You may not exit the quiz, test, or exam location
b. You must step away from the quiz, test, or exam materials. You may not remain at your assigned desk nor take materials with you to the designated break area.
c. You may not communicate with anyone except the Invigilator.

• If you are authorized by your Disability Counsellor for breaks "with stopped-clock", any breaks that you take during a quiz, test, or exam will not count against your authorized writing time - provided you do not exceed your permitted maximum break time (as defined by your Disability Counsellor).

• If you are authorized by your Disability Counsellor for breaks "without stopped-clock" or you are not specifically authorized for breaks at all as part of your accommodation plan, any breaks that you take during a quiz, test, or exam will count against your authorized writing time.

4. Washroom Breaks

• If you wish to take a washroom break during a quiz, test, or exam, you must notify the Invigilator upon beginning and upon ending the break.

• During a washroom break, you may not exit the quiz, test, or exam location nor may you take any quiz, test, or exam materials (such as pens) or any bulky items (such as a jacket) with you into the washroom. The washroom break will count against your authorized writing time unless you are authorized by your Disability Counsellor for breaks "with stopped-clock"  - provided you do not exceed your permitted maximum break time (as defined by your Disability Counsellor).

5. Test and Exam Aids

• A test or exam aid is different than an accommodation.
a. An accommodation is authorized by your Disability Counsellor at Accessibility Services to address a disability-necessitated requirement (e.g. additional writing time, computer, etcetera).
b. A test or exam aid is an item that provides academic assistance during a test or exam. It is authorized by the course instructor or course coordinator for use by all students in the course (e.g. aid sheet, non-programmable calculator, translation dictionary, etcetera).

• When you write a quiz, test, or exam with Test and Exam Services, you will be permitted to use the same test and exam aids as your classmates are using.

6. Calculator Use during a Test or Exam

• If your classmates are not authorized to use a calculator as a test or exam aid during the evaluation but you are authorized by your Disability Counsellor to use a calculator as an accommodation:
a. You must arrive at the quiz, test, or exam location with a printed "Calculator Approval Form" that is completed and signed by the course instructor or course coordinator.
b. You can obtain a copy of the Calculator Approval Form from Accessibility Services.
c. You provide the calculator, which must comply with the specifications outlined by the course instructor or course coordinator.

7. Dictionary Use during a Test or Exam

• If your classmates are not authorized to use a dictionary as a test or exam aid during the evaluation but you are authorized by your Disability Counsellor to use a dictionary as an accommodation:
a. You must arrive at the quiz, test, or exam location with a printed "Dictionary Approval Form" that is completed and signed by the course instructor or course coordinator.
b. You can obtain a copy of the Dictionary Approval Form from Accessibility Services.
c. Test and Exam Services will provide you with an English-language standard, spelling, or electronic dictionary to comply with the specifications outlined by the course instructor or coordinator.
d. If the course instructor or coordinator permits a language translation dictionary or other course-specific dictionary, you provide the dictionary.

8. Atypical Situations

• If an atypical situation arises during the quiz, test, or exam, notify the Invigilator.

• Such situations may include, but are not limited to, questions about the test, questions about your accommodations, concerns about temperature, noise, or other distractions, technology malfunctions, anxiety, and illness.

9. Questions for the Course Instructor

• If you have a question about the quiz, test, or exam, notify the Invigilator. The Invigilator will attempt to contact the course instructor, course coordinator, or course teaching assistant by telephone or, if the class sitting is occurring in the same building, by seeking out the instructor, coordinator, or teaching assistant in-person. If this attempt is successful, you will be put in contact with the instructor.

• If the Invigilator's attempt to reach the instructor, coordinator, or teaching assistant is unsuccessful, the fact that you had an unresolved question will be documented. The Invigilator's documentation will be forwarded to the instructor with your quiz, test, or exam materials.

10. Test and Exam Abandonment

• If you abandon a term test partway through, whether or not the reason for abandonment is disability-related, you will need to request a make-up sitting from the course instructor. Course-specific procedures for requesting a make-up sitting of a term test apply to all students, including those registered with Accessibility Services. On that note, be aware that requesting a make-up sitting of a test does not guarantee that the course instructor will authorize a make-up sitting. For more information about make-up tests, review the section of this handbook entitled "Make-Up Term Tests".

• If you abandon a final exam partway through, whether or not the reason for abandonment is disability-related, you will need to file a petition to request that the final exam be deferred to a later date. Faculty-specific procedures for filing a petition to defer a final exam apply to all students, including those registered with Accessibility Services. On that note, be aware that filing a petition to defer a final exam does not guarantee that a deferral will be granted. For more information about deferred exams, review the section of this handbook entitled "Deferred Final Exams".



WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER YOU WRITE

1. Completing the Test or Exam

• All writing must occur between the announced commencement and the announced conclusion of the quiz, test, or exam. Extra time is not given for:
a. Writing your name and student number on the quiz, test, or exam materials
b. Contacting the course instructor for clarification
c. Finishing up "just one last" word, sentence, or question
d. Filling in your multiple choice answer sheet
e. Editing your quiz, test, or exam responses

2. Submitting Test and Exam Materials

• At the conclusion of the quiz, test, or exam, the Invigilator will inform you that your authorized writing time is over. You must stop writing or typing immediately.

• The Invigilator will collect your quiz, test, or exam materials, including:
a. The quiz, test, or exam question paper
b. Used and unused booklets, multiple choice answer sheets, and scrap paper
c. Handwritten and/or typed responses (printed in the Invigilators' Office)
d. Authorized aid sheets

3. Submission Checklist

• The Invigilator will account for the quiz, test, and exam materials that you have submitted on a Submission Checklist form.

• You will be asked to review and sign the Submission Checklist to confirm that the items documented are, in fact, the materials that you have submitted.

4. Leaving the Quiz, Test, or Exam Location

• The Invigilator will return your TCard and you are free to leave, unless sequestering is required as outlined in the section of this handbook entitled "Sequestering".

• Note that you may not leave Test and Exam Services with any quiz, test, or exam materials in your possession.

5. Sending Term Test Materials for Marking

• When Test and Exam Services obtains your term test materials from your course instructor, the instructor is asked to state a location on the St. George Campus to which your completed test should be sent.

• Typically, the location specified by your instructor will be the main office at the academic department through which the course is offered.

• Test and Exam Services assigns your completed test a tracking number, places your test materials in an envelope, and then couriers your test materials to the location specified by your instructor within three business days of the date that you wrote the test. The recipient's name, signature, and telephone number are required upon delivery. Test and Exam Services retains this information, as well as date, time, and location of delivery.

• The recipient of your test materials at the location specified by your instructor then forwards your test materials to the instructor, course coordinator, or teaching assistant responsible for marking the evaluation.

6. Sending Final Exam Materials for Marking

• In the majority of cases, Test and Exam Services obtains your final exam materials from the Office of the Faculty Registrar and sends your completed exam materials back to the Office of the Faculty Registrar. (Note that there are a few exceptions, including final exams for graduate-level courses and some of the smaller professional faculties.)

• Test and Exam Services couriers your exam materials to the Office of the Faculty Registrar within one business day of the date that you wrote the exam. The recipients name and signature are required upon delivery. Test and Exam Services retains this information, as well as date and location of delivery.

• The recipient of your exam materials at the Office of the Faculty Registrar typically then forwards your exam materials to the academic department through which the course is offered.

• The recipient of your exam materials at the department, in turn, forwards your exam materials to the instructor, course coordinator, or teaching assistant responsible for marking the evaluation.
