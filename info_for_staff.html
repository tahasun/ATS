            Highly-qualified graduate students at the University of Toronto act

            invigilators undergo an intensive training process and are specifically
            trained to administer tests/exams to students with disabilities in
            accordance with the University of Toronto's examination policies and
            procedures. They are trained to balance academic accommodation needs

            Every student who writes tests/exams with ATS has an individualized
            academic accommodation plan. The amount of additional writing time
            authorized, if any, is determined by Accessibility Services (AS) on
            a student-by-student basis based on the student's disability and
            documentation.

            ATS works in close partnership with Computing and Networking Services
            (CNS) to ensure that the university-issued computers to which some
            students have access during tests/exams are secure. The computers
            are password-protected; software access is restricted based on each
            student's unique authorized academic accommodation requirements; USB
            ports are locked; and internet access is disabled.

          <p>
            The majority of accommodated tests/exams are administered at the same
            times as the regularly-scheduled class sittings. That said, the
            University of Toronto allows for specific exceptions to be made
            within established parameters when a student's assigned test/exam
            accommodations prohibit him/her from writing a test/exam at the same
            time as his/her classmates. In these cases, ATS is required to
            reschedule the test/exam to comply with the student's accommodations
            as outlined by Accessibility Services (AS). When a quiz or term test
            is rescheduled by ATS for disability-related reasons, the course
            instructor or the designated departmental contact is notified of the
            rescheduling. This notification is included in the automated quiz or
            term test request e-mail. For a rescheduled final exam, the faculty
            through which the course is offered is notified.
