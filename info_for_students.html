          <h3>Academic Conflicts</h3>
          <p>
            If you have two tests or exams that are overlapping or scheduled at
            the same time, request accommodations for both final exams by
            registering with Accommodated Testing Services for each one, as you
            normally would. ATS will adjust your exam schedule to remedy the
            conflict and notify you of the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your professor will be lecturing immediately before or
            <strong>after</strong> your quiz or test, they will need to let us
            know the lecture start time. When you make a request for a quiz or
            test, an email is sent to your professor to confirm the details of
            the evaluation. If your professor lets us know that you have a
            lecture directly after the quiz or test, we will schedule your
            accommodated sitting of the quiz or test to allow for "travel time"
            to return to the classroom. If your professor is lecturing
            <strong>before</strong> the test/exam, you will need to request
            permission for a later start time than the class (i.e. 15 minutes)
            to allow for travel time from your class to our test site.
            It is a good idea to be in touch with your professor to let them
            know that this is something you may require.

          <h3>Automatic Test and Exam Rescheduling</h3>

          <h4>End of Day</h4>
          <p>
            If you are registered to write with Accommodated Testing Services and your
            extra writing time and/or break accommodations cause your test/exam
            end time to be later than our test site closing time (10:30 PM),
            your test/exam will automatically be rescheduled to start at an
            earlier time to ensure that your test/exam end time is at or before
            closing time.
          </p>

          <h4>Earlier Start Time - Midterm Periods and Exam Periods</h4>
          <p>
            During busy times of the academic year, when there are significant
            increases in the number of requests for accommodated tests and exams,
            your test/exam sitting may be rescheduled up to one hour earlier
            than the class sitting if deemed necessary by Accommodated Testing Services.
          </p>

          <h4>Time Shifting Accommodations</h4>
          <p>
            If you have a time shifting accommodation, some or all of your
            test/exam dates and/or times may be automatically rescheduled to
            comply with the requirements of the accommodation. Automatic
            rescheduling of your tests and exams will happen in accordance with
            the established procedure. Please consult with your Advisor or ATS

                  When your writing time has expired, you are expected to stop

            During the writing of a test/exam with Accommodated Testing Services, you
            may only have in your possession materials and items expressly
            authorized by the Invigilator.

              Possession of an unauthorized aid during a test/exam, even if

              carries a significant penalty.
            </li>

            <li>
              When the Invigilator announces that the test/exam is over, you
              must stop writing or typing immediately. Failing to do so is an
              academic offense.

            <li>
              Quiz/test/exam materials are restricted and you may not keep any
